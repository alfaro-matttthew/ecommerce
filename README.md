# Ecommerce


## Description 

---

This project manipulates an ecommerce database using routes. I wanted to learn more about how MVC design worked. I built this project to be able to view, add, update, and delete data from a database. It paves the road of the back end of the application to be able to edit the database. I learned how to utilize all elements of CRUD.
